            To determine whether a cassava plant is healthy, you should consider several factors, including the plant's appearance, growth, and overall condition. Here are some key indicators to help you assess cassava plant health: <br>
            <b>>1. Leaf Appearance:</b<br>
            - Leaf Color: Healthy cassava leaves should be deep green and vibrant. Yellowing or browning of leaves can indicate nutrient deficiencies, pests or disease. <br>
            - Leaf shape and size: Cassava leaves should be uniform in size and shape, without any deformation or abnormal growth.<br>
          
            <b>2. Stem and Branches:</b><br>
            - Color of the stem: The stem should be firm and green, without any signs of wetness, browning or damage.<br>
            - Growth: A healthy cassava plant should produce new leaves and stems with regular growth.<br>
            - No excessive branch dieback: There should be no signs of excessive branch or stem dieback, which may indicate disease or damage.<br>
         
            <b>3. Root:</b><br>
            - Tuber development: The primary edible part of cassava is the tuber. A healthy cassava plant should have well-developed and large tubers in the soil.<br>
            -Root Color: Tubers should be clear, creamy-white or light brown in color. Discolored or dark spots can be signs of disease or damage.<br>
            - Root texture: Tubers should be firm and free from soft spots or rot.<br>
         
            <b>4. Pest and disease free:</b><br>
            - Check for signs of common cassava pests such as mealybugs, aphids or cassava hornworms. Pests can cause visible damage to leaves and stems.<br>
            - Look for symptoms of diseases such as cassava mosaic disease or cassava brown streak disease, which can cause characteristic leaf thickening, yellowing or necrosis.<br>
         
            <b>5. Weed control: </b><br>
            - Make sure the area around the cassava plant is free of weeds, as weeds can compete for nutrients and water.<br>
         
            <b>6. Proper nutrition and soil health:</b><br>
            - Healthy cassava plants require well-drained soil with the right nutrients. Conduct a soil test to ensure plants are receiving adequate nutrients. Apply suitable fertilizers as needed.<br>
            - Maintain soil pH levels within the recommended range for cassava growth.<br>
         
            <b>7. Adequate hydration:</b><br>
            - Cassava plants prefer well-drained soil but require regular watering to establish and maintain healthy growth. Make sure the plant gets enough water during dry periods.<br>
         
            <b>8. Sun exposure:</b><br>
            - Cassava plants thrive in full sunlight. Make sure the plant is not shaded by tall plants or structures.<br>
         
            <b>9. Trimming and Maintenance:</b><br>
            - Prune the cassava plant to remove dead or diseased branches. It helps promote healthy growth.<br>
         
            <b>10. Solid support (if applicable):</b><br>
            - If your cassava plants are tall and need support, make sure the support structures are strong and in good condition.<br>
