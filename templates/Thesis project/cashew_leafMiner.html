            Leaf mining disease in cashew trees is caused by the larvae of certain insects
            These leafmining insects belong to the order Lepidoptera and their larvae tunnel through leaves.
            Cashew trees produce distinctive patterns of damage. Leaf miner infections can affect health and
            Productivity of cashew tree.<br>
            Here's how leafminer disease typically works on cashew trees: <br>
            Larval feeding: Adult leaf miner moths or flies lay eggs on cashew tree leaves. when
            When the eggs hatch, the resulting larvae feed on the leaf tissue between the upper and lower leaf surfaces. they are
            Feeding, they create narrow, winding tunnels or "mines" in leaves. <br>
            Visible damage: The presence of leaf miner larvae is often evident by snakes or crawls
            Patterns on leaves, which are formed as larvae feed and tunnel. These patterns may vary
            The appearance depends on the species of leaf miner. <br>
            Effects on trees: Although leaf miners do not usually cause severe damage to cashew trees, they are heavy
            Infection reduces photosynthesis and overall plant vigor. This may result in
            Reduction affects growth and potentially cashew yield.
            <br>
            Management of leaf mining of cashew tree is usually cultural, chemical and
            Preventive measures, including:
            <br>     
            <b>Spinosad, Neem Oil, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), Pyrethroids, Diatomaceous Earth, Mineral Oil,
                Insect Growth Regulators (IGRs). </b> <br>
            <b>Before using any pesticide, it is important to:</b><br>
            Read and follow product label instructions carefully.
            Wear appropriate protective clothing and gear when handling and applying pesticides.
            Apply pesticides at recommended times and in suitable weather conditions.
            Follow recommended safety precautions to protect yourself, others and the environment. <br><br>
            Management: Controlling leaf miners on cashew trees can be challenging. Practice, eg
            Maintaining good garden hygiene and removing infected leaves can help reduce infestation.
            Insecticides can also be used to manage severe infestations, but care must be taken in selecting products
            Which is safe for both the cashew tree and the environment. <br>
            It is important for cashew growers to regularly monitor and receive their trees for signs of leaf mining damage
            Appropriate measures for infection control, if necessary. Integrated Pest Management (IPM)
            Strategies that combine cultural, biological, and chemical control methods can be effective in control
            Reduces environmental impact when leaf mining pests. <br>
