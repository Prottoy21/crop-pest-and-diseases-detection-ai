            Gummosis affects various parts of the plant, especially branches and stems. This disease is
            Characterized by the discharge of a thick, sticky substance from the affected area.<br>
            Here are some key facts about gamosis disease of cashew trees: <br>

            Bacterial specific causative organisms may vary depending on region and environmental conditions. <br>
            <b>Symptoms</b>: The primary symptom of gummosis is the discharge of a thick, sticky gum or resin.

            <br>
             
            <b>Copper-Based Fungicides, Mancozeb, Thiophanate-methyl, Propiconazole, Azoxystrobin, 
            Carbendazim.</b> <br>
            <b>Causes: </b>Gamosis can be caused by a variety of factors including physical injury to the plant (eg
            pruning wounds or damage to agricultural equipment), stress due to environmental factors such as drought or

            Removal and disposal of infected plant material can help reduce the impact of the disease. in some cases,
            Fungicides or bactericides can be used as a preventive measure or to treat the affected area. <br>
            <b>Prevention: </b>Preventive measures include avoiding unnecessary damage to cashew trees, ensuring proper
            Irrigation and soil management to reduce environmental stress, and maintain good overall vegetation
            Selecting disease-resistant cashew varieties can also help prevent gummosis. <br>
            It is essential for cashew growers to regularly monitor and receive their trees for signs of gummosis
            Management and taking appropriate measures to prevent its spread. Proper care and attention can help alleviate it
            Effects of this disease on cashew orchards and maintaining healthy cashew trees for good yield
